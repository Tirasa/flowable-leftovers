# Flowable leftovers

As explained by [this message](https://forum.flowable.org/t/module-flowable-json-converter-and-flowable-ui-modeler-frontend-missing-in-7-0-0-m1/10061/7) in the Flowable forum, not all components released with 6.8.0 are scheduled for next stable version 7.0.0.

The purpose of this repository is to attempt to migrate the leftover components to 7.0.0.
